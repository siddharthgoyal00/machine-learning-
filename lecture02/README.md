# Supervised Learning 
## Process of Supervised Learning Algorithm 
   - training data set 
   - give it to the learning algorithm 
   - hypothesis (input -> hypothesis -> output) 

## Example for supervised learing problem  
### problem:- predicting the prices of houses 
## Algorithms
    - linear regression 
    - gradient descent  batch/ stochastic
    - normal equation
